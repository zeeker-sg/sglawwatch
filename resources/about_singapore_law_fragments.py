"""Stub resource for the about_singapore_law_fragments table — real rows come
from about_singapore_law.py.

The fragments table is populated by ``about_singapore_law.fetch_fragments_data``
during the ``about_singapore_law`` resource's fragments phase (zeeker.toml:
``[resource.about_singapore_law] fragments = true``). This file exists only
because zeeker's builder treats every ``[resource.X]`` section in zeeker.toml
as a buildable resource and fails the build when ``resources/X.py`` is
missing — and the ``[resource.about_singapore_law_fragments]`` section must
stay, because it carries the Datasette column descriptions for the fragments
table.

Returning an empty list makes zeeker record this resource as
``[SKIP] no data returned`` without touching the table.
